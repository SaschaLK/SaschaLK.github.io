                MediTech was an award-winning Life-Action Game with multiple stages, including a public closing event.<br><br>
                The stages consisted of a setup stage in which participants where “recruited” via hints across the city as well as via web presence. <br>
                A validation stage where participants had to solve riddles to become eligible to participate in the final event and lastly the Life-Action stage, where we invited all participants who successfully solved all puzzles.<br>
                Although each puzzle didn’t have just one correct solution, it is dependent on each participants answer they would get affiliated with one out of four starting characters. 
                During the life event, the participants could choose which further actions to take and therefore change the outcome.

                My position for this thirty-man project was Writer, Project Designer, Game Designer as well being part of the Project Managing Group. I designed the Story and general layout of the events as well as defining the setting.
                <br><br>
                The project also won the "Karl H. Ditze Prize" for best project 2017.
