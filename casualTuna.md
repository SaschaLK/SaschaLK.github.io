            <h2>Casual Tuna</h2>
            <p id="textContent">
                Casual Tuna was a game project and part of the <a href="https://www.igjam.eu/jams/igjam-11-feat-hamburger-fern-hochschule/">InnoGamesJam #11</a>. 
                <br><br>
                The motivation for this project was to enable inexperienced users, and users who were unfamiliar with the music terminology, to compose and create their very own music. 
                <br>
                Meant as an introduction to the composing scene, this web application introduces the player to the first essentials of most music software, while doing so in a playful manner.
                This was achieved by simplifying the interface and creating a level system, which gradually unlocked more tools as the time passed on.
                <br><br>
                My roles where Game Designer, Project Manager as well as Scrum Master for the duration of the Jam. I designed the level system as well as the user experience, while staying in touch with every member of the team. Consequently I was responsible for combining and finalizing all ideas as well as the creative input from every member.
