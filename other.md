                    <h4>VR UFO</h4>
                    <p>
                        In this game the player is in control of a spaceship and tries to maneuver via an unconvential input method. For this we build a balance board which was used to steer the spaceship on the horizontal axis. Incoming astroids had to be shot down with a regular controller. 
                        <br><br>
                        I was responsible for modelling the spaceship and partially for the theme and design of the game.
