                   In this game the player is in control of a spaceship and tries to maneuver via an unconvential input method. For this we build a balance board which was used to steer the spaceship on the horizontal axis. Incoming astroids had to be shot down with a regular controller.

                   I was responsible for modelling the spaceship and partially for the theme and design of the game.
