                Mining Man is a small mini game in which the player tries to collect as many gems as possible in a given timeframe. He competes to achieve the highest score. 
                <br>
                This game was meant to be a small application for a bigger environment, such as a mini game collection.
                <br>
                The motivation for this project was to research intuitive design and to create an environment which allows players to quickly and effortlessly do the intended tasks implemented by the designer. This was particularly relevant for VR games and VR environments.
                <br><br> 
                My responsibilities in this project where to design the game, manage the project as well as to program it.
